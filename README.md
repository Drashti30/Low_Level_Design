# üß† Low-Level Design (LLD) Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of object-oriented system design problems implemented in Python, prepared as part of my final-round interview preparation for the Amazon SDE1 role. These implementations focus on class responsibilities, modularity, scalability, and real-world modeling.

‚úÖ I reached the final loop of Amazon SDE1 interviews and was placed on the waitlist.
